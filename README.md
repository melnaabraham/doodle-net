A web-based multiplayer drawing grid inspired by Etch-A-Sketch. Multiple users can draw simultaneously on a shared grid in real-time using Socket.IO.

I built this project to learn how WebSockets work and how real-time communication is handled in modern web applications.

### Built With

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime environment for running the server  
- **Express** — Web framework to serve static files and handle HTTP requests  
- **Socket.IO** — Real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** — Frontend interface and interaction
